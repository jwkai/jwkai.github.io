I am an MSc student in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, supervised by [Ron Garcia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rxg/) and [Alex Summers](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~alexsumm/) in the [Software Practices Lab](https://spl.cs.ubc.ca/index.html).

My research draws on programming language semantics, automated reasoning and probabilistic logic. Currently, I am focusing on the design of probabilistic programming languages.

I am fortunate to have worked with Alex Summers on the [Viper](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper.html) verification framework, and with [Mina Tahmasbi Arashloo](https://mina.arashloo.net/) at the University of Waterloo on formal methods for network performance analysis. I previously worked as a long-term research assistant and lab manager at the UBC Vision Lab with [James Enns](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/james-enns/), where I developed studies on perception-action theory and social psychology.

I have also worked for several years a research software developer in virology and neuroscience labs.
