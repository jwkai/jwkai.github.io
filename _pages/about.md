I am a student in the BCS-ICS (second Bachelor's in Computer Science) program at the University of British Columbia. Before this, I studied Mathematics and Music at McGill University.

My current interests center around **automated reasoning and formal methods**, including program verification, static analysis, programming language theory, decision theory and probabilistic reasoning. I am interested in applying these concepts towards the creation of **safe and explainable AI**. 

I am fortunate to have worked with [Dr. Alex Summers](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~alexsumm/) at UBC on the [Viper](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper.html) project, and with [Dr. Mina Tahmasbi Arashloo](https://mina.arashloo.net/) at the University of Waterloo on network performance analysis. I previously worked as a long-term research assistant and lab manager at the UBC Vision Lab with [Dr. James Enns](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/james-enns/), where I helped develop studies on action-perception theory, object recognition and social psychology.

I have additionally worked for several years a software developer in scientific research, primarily involving full-stack development, data analysis and signal processing.
