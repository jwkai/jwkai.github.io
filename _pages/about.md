I am an MSc student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of British Columbia, supervised by [Ron Garcia](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rxg/) and [Alex Summers](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~alexsumm/).

My interests include programming language semantics, automated reasoning and probabilistic logic. I amm particularly interested in applications to formal verification and the design of safe/explainable AI systems. I try to resist the [dichotomy](https://windowsontheory.org/2015/06/09/why-doesnt-acm-have-a-sig-for-theoretical-computer-science-guest-post-by-moshe-vardi/) of Theory A (theory of algorithms) and Theory B (theory of software).

I am fortunate to have worked with Alex Summers on the [Viper](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper.html) project, and with [Mina Tahmasbi Arashloo](https://mina.arashloo.net/) at the University of Waterloo on network performance analysis. I previously worked as a long-term research assistant and lab manager at the UBC Vision Lab with [James Enns](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/james-enns/), where I developed studies on action-perception theory, object recognition and social psychology.

I also worked for several years a software developer (data analysis and full-stack development) in virology and neuroscience labs.
