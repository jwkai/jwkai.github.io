I am a student in the BCS-ICS (second Bachelor's in Computer Science) program at the University of British Columbia. I previously earned a BA in Mathematics and Music at McGill University.

My interests center around **automated reasoning and formal methods**. I have research experience with program verification, programming language theory, model checking and probabilistic logic. I am increasingly interested in **safe and explainable AI**, particularly approaches involving causal inference, probabilistic graphical models and probabilistic programming.

I am fortunate to have worked with [Dr. Alex Summers](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~alexsumm/) at UBC on the [Viper](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/viper.html) project, and with [Dr. Mina Tahmasbi Arashloo](https://mina.arashloo.net/) at the University of Waterloo on network performance analysis. I previously worked as a long-term research assistant and lab manager at the UBC Vision Lab with [Dr. James Enns](https://psych.ubc.ca/profile/james-enns/), where I helped develop studies on action-perception theory, object recognition and social psychology.

I have additionally worked for several years a software developer (mostly data analysis and full-stack development) in the context of bioinformatics, neuroscience and cognitive psychology.
